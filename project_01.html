		<p>This is an animation group project. The animation shows the differences of the two bottles. We had the idea of teaming up with Stanley’s bottle brand as they have a recognisable brand. </p>

		<h3>Ball Movement</h3>
		<p>The ball is a flat 2d object brought to life with an oval shadow under it. The ball and shadow are connected to a null object in their movement and the ball rotation is separate. I calculated the distance and rotation of the ball so it wasn’t gliding on the floor.</p>

		<h3>Stanley Jump</h3>
		<p>The bottle animation was more complex. The legs bend and compress before he jumps which is the same distance it squats. I used the warp tool to achieve this. The shadow is aligned on the same key frames of his movements. I used a simple scale effect to do this.</p>

		<h3>Floating</h3>
		<p>The floating was done with a wiggle effect to add movement. The teardrop coming from the eye was linked to the object. It slowly falls by the side until it hits the water. The droplet is faded out from the top. As soon as it hits the water it is then its separate layer and effect of an oval stroke that fades its path to create a splash effect.</p>

		<h3>Fish</h3>
		<p>The fish were simple in their movements. I eased them with a long stop like they were still floating in liquid. As they aren’t the focus a simple flip done with the scale effect was all that was needed for their turning animation.</p>

	<h3>Reflection On This Project</h3>
	
	<div>
		<p>Over this project, I have learned completely different ways of viewing graphic design and seeing it in a new light. Even though it’s similar to what I am used to the whole medium has changed. Instead of telling a story through one singular image, it’s across 25 a second. I believe I have a strong understanding of Illustrator. Every shortcut you could take to make something look good went out the window when it had to move and interact with other elements on the page. </p>
		<p>I came across multiple issues when first creating something. It became frustrating almost, however, as soon as I got used to the nuances that came with After Effects everything just started flowing as I overcame the issues I was having. This was mainly done through trial and error after attending and watching a wide variety of tutorials.</p>
		<p>Creating a story over a minute long that effectively showed our message was something relatively new concept to me and the rest of my team. I have only had a brief play with Premiere Pro on a past project I’ve done and I've only seen on the internet the extent of what After Effects can do.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="two">
		<p>My initial story idea came to fruition as we decided to go with it for what we did. I found out what the rest of the team’s strengths were and importantly what they didn’t enjoy doing. This allowed us to come up with a design style and workload that best-suited everyone. This allowed everyone to flourish and enjoy the work they were doing. </p>
		<p>I’d say personally there is always more you can do to improve something and I feel it’s given me a great introduction to motion graphics. I know the more I do it in the future it should be easier to recall what I've already learned so every idea in my head can come to life.  </p>
		<p>I enjoyed creating my motion graphics and adding small details. As I did the sound design I had a different look at how my audio and graphics could work together to make it that much better.</p>
