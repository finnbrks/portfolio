		<p>Welcome to my creative corner on the web! I’m Finn, a graphic designer currently nurturing my creativity and honing my craft at the Arts University Bournemouth. My journey into the world of graphic design started at a young age when I started to compare different labels on bottles, what made me want to pick them up, how it made me feel and eventually buy one.</p>
		<p>I am a natural leader in a group. For me, it is less about shining in the spotlight and more about illuminating the path for others. It's about listening, adapting, and gently guiding, ensuring that every voice is heard and everyone’s talents are being realised. I learnt to navigate Adobe Creative Suite effortlessly and utilize its advanced features and keyboard shortcuts which saves me time creating my ideas. I am a quick learner, always willing with an open mind to improve my skills and explore different routes I can take with my work.</p>
		<p>I’ve worked with an experienced graphic designer based in London getting an insight into their workflow and how the industry is. I worked on a live brief during my time there. I liked having a design style to follow while pushing the limits of what I could do with it.</p>
		<p>When I’m not designing, I produce and perform electronic dance music with my songs reaching tens or hundreds of thousands of plays on streaming sites. My songs have also been played at a variety of events, and festivals and even on Triple J ABC an Australian national radio station.</p>
		<p>My next step in design is getting an internship to get more of a feel for the industry. This will give me more experience in studio life where I can make important connections and gain valued skills on the job.</p>
		<p>If you want someone outgoing with a fresh take on design please get in touch, I would love to share more of my work and skills with you.</p>
		<p>Have a good one!</p>
